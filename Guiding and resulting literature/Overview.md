# Guiding and resulting literature

## [Learning analytics 1-page overview for districts](https://github.com/lastingerlx/datahub/blob/0184603538924b9165e09623248e0d4364ce0f23/Guiding%20and%20resulting%20literature/Learning%20Analytics%201-page.pdf)

As we were first establishing our researcher-practitioner partnership, we wanted to establish a shared understanding of the concept of using learner analytics to inform instructional decisions.  We composed and shared the following document with our district partners and followed it with a live conversation to allow for further questions and discussions.   

## Annotated bibliography of literature in math, learning analytics, and equity

Our work is founded on an in depth literature review in alignment of our value of evidence-based practices.   The purpose of this document is serve as a synthesis that addresses what has been learned around analytics for equitable math education and to identify guidance from existing literature that can practically be applied to design and development of data tools for math education. Keywords used in literature search: Math Education, Equity, Data OR Analytics, Data Science for Learning, Dashboards OR Reports 

## Article: A review of learning analytics opportunities and challenges relevant for PK-12 education and mathematics teaching and learning

Use of learning analytics to improve educational outcomes is a growing area of research. While learning analytics research has been more prevalent in higher education contexts, this study presents findings from a qualitative metasynthesis of 48 research publications related to opportunities and challenges relevant to learning analytics design, implementation, and research at the PK-12 level. Our findings indicate that, while many see the educational benefits of learning analytics (e.g., more equitable instruction, individualized learning, enhanced assessment for learning); others remain unconvinced by a lack of evidence of improved outcomes and concerned about persistent challenges and potentially harmful impacts (e.g., infringement on usersâ€™ privacy, misuse or misinterpretation of data by educators). We conclude by considering implications for mathematics education stemming from our analysis of learning analytics and posing questions to shape future research and key developments in mathematics education as learning analytics become more prevalent.
