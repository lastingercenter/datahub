# Math Nation and Flamingo Research Partnership for Algebra Learning in Florida   

Achieving the greatest impact on teacher practice and student learning outcomes requires math learning experiences that are targeted, relevant, and applicable to each participant. This can be efficiently achieved with connected student, educator, and digital content data that can be continuously accessed by educators and researchers in real time, that can be exported in usable formats, and that can be analyzed to address the most pressing questions in our schools. The University of Florida Lastinger Center for Learning developed research infrastructure for the Math Nation and Flamingo Learning platforms to enable new R&D in math learning for teachers and students, called Flamingo Data Lagoon.

The Data Lagoon Architecture document outlines the overall database architecture and Azure resources employed to facility the data ingestion, storage, transformation, and access associated with the Math Nation and Flamingo reporting for teachers, faculty, and students.  We leveraged a range of resources provided by Microsoft Education, including Open Education Analytics reference architecture and open source assets, as well as Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Blob Storage, and PowerBI.

Our overarching project goal is to provide widespread access to data that can uncover patterns of inequity to inform changes in instructional practices, broader R&D, and improved policy.   We envision the data we provide will inform decisions about instructional practices, AI development, and education resource allocation to promote a more equitable world in which all students have equal opportunities for success.
