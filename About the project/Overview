#Math Nation and Flamingo Research Partnership for Algebra Learning in Florida   

Achieving the greatest impact on teacher practice and student learning outcomes requires math learning experiences that are targeted, relevant, and applicable to each participant. This can be efficiently achieved with connected student, educator, and digital content data that can be continuously accessed by educators and researchers in real time, that can be exported in usable formats, and that can be analyzed to address the most pressing questions in our schools. The University of Florida Lastinger Center for Learning developed research infrastructure for the Math Nation and Flamingo Learning platforms to enable new R&D in math learning for teachers and students, called Flamingo Data Lagoon.
