# Instruments and tools

So many education solutions are created for teachers- but shockingly- without their input in the development and design of the tool.  This unfortunate pattern results in an abundance of available tools that are not actually helpful!  We decided to take a different approach through an involved Researcher-Practitioner Partnership.  We started each development phase by asking our educator end-users about their current tools, including their challenges and wish-list for improvements, and used their words to inform our strategy.

So many education solutions are created for teachers- but shockingly- without their input in the development and design of the tool.  This unfortunate pattern results in an abundance of available tools that are not actually helpful!  We decided to take a different approach through an involved Researcher-Practitioner Partnership.  We started each development phase by asking our educator end-users about their current tools, including their challenges and wish-list for improvements, and used their words to inform our strategy.  This Focus Group Protocol outlines how we structured early conversations with educators.   

The transcripts from these conversations were analyzed and used to inform our decisions about which reports we want to create for teachers first, as well as a second set of questions for educators about our new ideas as part of our iterative design process.   

## Teacher focus group results

This document details our analysis of the Teacher Focus Groups.  It includes timestamped quotes that informed our development as well as the themes we identified and the usable implications we extracted. 

## Teacher survey items

After analyzing the outputs from the Teacher Focus Groups, we identified that many teachers wished to have a customizable report to facilitate conversations with parents about their kid’s performance.   

Next, we wanted to verify our understanding of educator wants and needs regarding these reports by soliciting feedback from a larger group of teachers.  This online survey was shared with all middle and high school math teachers in our partner school district, collecting a broader snapshot of how, when, and why they would use this report, as well as what data they would like to be able to include.

## Teacher survey results

After an initial needs gathering process with our partner school district’s administrators and a more targeted focus group with teachers, we surveyed a broader group of teachers to understand their specific requests and preferences regarding sharing data with parents.  This document includes a summary of the teachers’ responses to our survey; these were used to inform the Parent Teacher Conference Report design.   

## Learning analytics deck

This document provides a sample activity that can be utilized with education practitioners in need of support identifying their priorities.  We did not utilize this tool in this use case as our partner educators were advanced in their priority identification process.
