# Lastinger Data Lagoon
Welcome to the Data Lagoon GitHub, where we are sharing lots of information about our project development.  To learn more about the philosophies driving the first phase of our development, see below.  To learn more about how we informed and executed on our development, peruse the pages and documents housed here. 

This repository hosts outputs resulting from the development of the Center's research and development infrastructure, a collaboration among the [Lastinger Center for Learning](https://https://lastinger.center.ufl.edu),the [University of Florida College of Education](https://education.ufl.edu), [Study Edge](https://studyedge.com), and [Palm Beach school district](https://www.palmbeachschools.org). These resources relate to math education in a digital application, [Math Nation](https://www.mathnation.com/). Our goal in sharing this repository is to support math education research and development.

## Outcomes of this project include: 
- Functioning database infrastructure that extracts, cleans, prepares, and houses data from our online learning applications  
- Data dashboards and on-demand reports for educators, designed with educators, to inform equitable instructional strategies   
- Data portal for researchers from school districts, universities, and educational technology developers, designed to foster more rapid data-driven decision making and tech development in service of improved educational opportunities  

## Our Early Development Philosophy 

Achieving the greatest impact on teacher practice and student learning outcomes requires learning experiences that are targeted, relevant, and applicable to each participant. This can be efficiently achieved with connected student, educator, and digital content data that can be continuously accessed by educators and researchers in real time, that can be exported in usable formats, and that can be analyzed to address the most pressing questions in our schools. The University of Florida Lastinger Center for Learning is developing research infrastructure for our online learning applications, starting with our Math Nation and Flamingo Learning data, to enable new R&D in math learning for teachers and students.

## Our Global Access Strategy  

The University of Florida Lastinger Center for Learning is dedicated to expanding equitable access to high quality education for all educators and learners, regardless of circumstance.  The research data archive will be made freely available to school district partners, university researchers, and education technology researchers to promote further cycles of research and inquiry.  The data infrastructure and documentation made available through this project will be made freely available for the purposes of education, research, and development. Dissemination of improvements to math digital learning applications made as a result of the developments will be made available affordably. As such, the Global Access commitments directly align with the organization’s business model and values.
